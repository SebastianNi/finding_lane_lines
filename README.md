# Project: Finding Lane Lines
## My 1st Project in the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1

### Project Overview

In this project I detected lane lines in images and videos using Python and OpenCV.

### Output videos

The project outputs videos in which the lane lines are highlighted. The output videos can be watched here: [video 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0agIiDyIPj1d1YwbTNaZ0ZYczA), [video 2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0agIiDyIPj1MGVKNmNGMURqLXc) and [video 3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0agIiDyIPj1UkZtWjh5dkI3VGs).

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
- [MoviePy](http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need Udacity's test images and the video files **solidWhiteRight.mp4**, **solidYellowLeft.mp4** and **challenge.mp4**. You can find these files in the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1).

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook P1.ipynb```
