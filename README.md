# Project: Finding Lane Lines
## My 1st Project in the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1

### Project Overview
In this project I detected lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need Udacity's test images and the video files **solidWhiteRight.mp4**, **solidYellowLeft.mp4** and **challenge.mp4**. You can find these files in the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1).

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook P1.ipynb```
